üéØ Versione di Minecraft da usare su MultiMC
Molte delle mod, come cc-tweaked, createcasing_blocks, immersivepetroleum e Moonlight 3.0.0, specificano esplicitamente il supporto per Minecraft 1.20.1.

üìå Quindi devi creare un‚Äôistanza Minecraft versione 1.20.1 su MultiMC, con Forge (non Fabric o NeoForge), perch√©:

Molte mod (Create, Immersive Engineering, Kotlin for Forge) sono Forge-only.

Alcune mod indicano compatibilit√† con NeoForge, ma Forge √® generalmente retrocompatibile con queste versioni early NeoForge (come createcasing_blocks).

Se vuoi, posso aiutarti anche a esportare un pacchetto .zip per importarlo direttamente in MultiMC. Vuoi farlo?

# üéØ Minecraft Version and Setup Instructions

- **Minecraft version:** Use **1.20.1** for best compatibility.
- **Mod loader:** Use **Forge** (not Fabric or NeoForge) on MultiMC.
- **Reason:**
    - Many mods such as Create, Immersive Engineering, Kotlin for Forge are Forge-only.
    - Some mods indicate NeoForge compatibility, but Forge is generally backward compatible with early NeoForge versions (e.g., createcasing_blocks).
- Create a new Minecraft 1.20.1 instance in MultiMC with Forge installed.


# üìå Additional Notes

- If you want, I can help you export a `.zip` modpack file to import directly into MultiMC. Just ask!
- For the latest versions and downloads, always check the linked official mod pages.
- Some mods (e.g., EMI addons) are still under active development and may receive updates.

This README now provides clear mod names, descriptions, and direct links to trusted sources for downloads or information, improving usability and professionalism.
